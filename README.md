                                      # Analysis-of-open-loop-and-closed-loop-control-system
## Aim :
  To analyse the open loop and closed loop system having G(S)=1/(S^2+10S+20)  when an unit step input is applied using MATLAB.
## Apparatus Required:
  Computer with MATLAB software
## Theory
  ### Open loop control system
    In this system, the output doesn’t change the action of the control system. It doesn’t have any feedback. It is very simple, needs low maintenance, quick operation, and cost-effective. The accuracy of this system is low and less dependable.
    Open loop transfer function = G(S)H(S)=1/(S^2+10S+20)
